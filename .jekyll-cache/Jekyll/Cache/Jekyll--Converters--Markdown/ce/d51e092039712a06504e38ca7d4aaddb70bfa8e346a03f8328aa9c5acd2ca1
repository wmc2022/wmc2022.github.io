<h2 id="about-wmc">About WMC</h2>

<p>The purpose of WMC is to share new ideas, experiences and information about research and development of mixed criticality real-time systems. The workshop aims to bring together researchers working in fields relating to real-time systems with a focus on the challenges brought about by the integration of mixed criticality applications onto single-core, multi-core and many-core architectures. These challenges are cross-cutting. To advance rapidly, closer interaction is needed between the sub-communities involved in real-time operating systems / run-time environments / hypervisor, real-time scheduling, security, safety and timing analysis. The workshop aims to promote understanding of the fundamental problems that affect Mixed Criticality Systems (MCS) at all levels in the software/hardware stack and crucially the interfaces between them. The workshop will promote lively interaction, cross fertilisation of ideas, synergies, and closer collaboration across the breadth of the real-time community, as well as attracting industrialists from the aerospace, automotive and other industries with a specific interest in MCS. Original unpublished papers on all aspects of mixed criticality real-time systems are welcome.</p>
