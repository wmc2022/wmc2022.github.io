<p>The purpose of WMC is to share new ideas, experiences and information about research and development of mixed criticality real-time systems. The workshop aims to bring together researchers working in fields relating to real-time systems with a focus on the challenges brought about by the integration of mixed criticality applications onto single-core, multi-core and many-core architectures. These challenges are cross-cutting. To advance rapidly, closer interaction is needed between the sub-communities involved in real-time operating systems / run-time environments / hypervisor, real-time scheduling, security, safety and timing analysis. The workshop aims to promote understanding of the fundamental problems that affect Mixed Criticality Systems (MCS) at all levels in the software/hardware stack and crucially the interfaces between them. The workshop will promote lively interaction, cross fertilisation of ideas, synergies, and closer collaboration across the breadth of the real-time community, as well as attracting industrialists from the aerospace, automotive and other industries with a specific interest in MCS. Original unpublished papers on all aspects of mixed criticality real-time systems are welcome.</p>

<p>This year WMC will be hold jointly together with RTSS 2022 in Houston, Texas, USA.</p>

<h2 id="scope-of-workshop">Scope of Workshop</h2>

<p>Themes include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Task and system models for MCS on singlecore, multi-core, and many-core platforms.</li>
  <li>Comparison between MCS models (Vestal, DAL / IMA, SIL / AUTOSAR, …).</li>
  <li>Scheduling schemes and analyses for MCS, including the integration of appropriate models of overheads and delays.</li>
  <li>Operating systems, hypervisors, run-time environments and support for MCS, including data exchange and synchronisation across criticality levels, and issues relating to criticality mode.</li>
  <li>Analysis of worst-case execution times (WCET) relating to MCS.</li>
  <li>Mixed criticality communications mechanisms and analysis, including Network-on-Chip support.</li>
  <li>Safety and fault-tolerance mechanisms for real-time MCS systems.</li>
  <li>Probabilistic analysis techniques for MCS.</li>
  <li>Timing analysis and predictability of autonomous systems in a MCS context.</li>
</ul>

<p>The scope of the workshop is real-time, mixed criticality systems. Papers that do not relate to real-time behaviour (i.e. are solely about security or safety aspects of MCS) will be considered as out of scope.</p>
