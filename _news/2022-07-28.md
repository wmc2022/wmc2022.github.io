Welcome to Workshop on Mixed Criticality Systems 2022. 

On behave of the WMC'22 Program Committee, we are glad to announce that the WMC is accepted and will officially be held together with RTSS'22 in Houston.

More information can be found on the [RTSS'22 Hot Topics Day](http://2022.rtss.org/hot-topics-day-cfp/). 

Please consider to make a submission to WMC. You can find the call for papers [here](/cfp/). The submission link is also open on EasyChair, which can be accessed at: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wmc2022](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wmc2022).
