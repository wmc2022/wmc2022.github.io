Workshop program is announced


We are glad to announce that the WMC workshop program is out.

We will have three sessions â€“ two of which in the morning and one in the afternoon. The workshop will be started with a key note from Prof. Jian-Jia Chen on his latest work in mixed-criticality systems.

For more details, please check the [Program](/program) page.

We are looking forward to seeing all of you during the event at RTSS.
