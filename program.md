## Format of the Workshop

The 9th WMC workshop will be held jointly with [RTSS 2022](http://2022.rtss.org/) in a *hybrid* form.

Starting with a keynote from Prof Jian-Jia Chen, the workshop will have three sessions -- two of which in the morning and one in the afternoon. Each speaker is allocated a time slot of 20 minutes, where 15 minutes are for presentation and 5 minutes are for questions.

## Keynote

Prof. Jian-Jia Chen, TU Dortmund

He will talk his work: "Probabilistic Real-Time Scheduling and its Possible Link to Mixed-Criticality Systems", by Georg von der Brüggen, Sergey Bozhko, Mario Günzel, Kuan-Hsun Chen, Jian-Jia Chen and Björn Brandenburg.
