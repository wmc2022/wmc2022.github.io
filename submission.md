## Paper Format

Submissions must be in the same format as in the final proceedings (6 pages maximum, 2 columns, 10 pt, US Letter) compliant with the IEEE formatting guidelines. Papers exceeding the page limit will not be reviewed. The material must be *unpublished* and *not under submission* elsewhere. Papers must be submitted electronically in a pdf format. 

For work-already-published (WaP) session, we provide the opportunity for researchers to present high-quality journal contributions that have not been presented at a conference. Author(s) should provide an extended abstract that clearly states the contributions and key techniques of the research. For journals that were extended from a conference paper, we ask the authors to highlight what are the new contributions and the contents should lean towards the new contributions. The page limitation of the extended abstract is 4.

## Registration and Presentation

By submitting a paper, the authors confirm that if the paper is accepted, at least one author will register for the WMC 2022 workshop by the special registration deadline set in the notification of acceptance, and present the paper at the workshop either in person or online. 

## Proceedings

WMC will publish *informal* proceedings. The authors retain the copyright to their work and are free to submit extended versions to a conference or journal.
